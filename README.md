🎯 Hirst_Painting


🎨 Hirst Painting with Python Turtle

This project recreates a modern art-inspired dot painting using Python's Turtle graphics library, inspired by Damien Hirst’s iconic dot artworks — some of which are valued at over $12 million! 💸

By combining color theory, loops, and graphics, the code generates a colorful 10x10 grid of dots with random selections from a pre-defined RGB palette.


🧠 What I Learned

* Using the `turtle` module for drawing graphics
* Working with RGB color values using `turtle.colormode(255)`
* Randomization in Python with `random.choice()`
* Loop control and grid-based positioning
* Creating reusable color palettes


🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).
2. Run the script in a Python environment that supports GUI graphics (e.g. IDLE, VSCode, PyCharm, etc.).
3. Watch the magic happen — a colorful grid of dots will appear on the screen!

🧾 Requirements

  No external packages required — only the built-in `turtle` and `random` modules.


💡 Inspiration

  This project was part of a Python development course where we recreated Damien Hirst’s famous dot paintings using code.
